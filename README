======================

   This module implements a wrapper for Net::SMTP, enabling
   over-SSL/STARTTLS support.  This module inherits all the methods from
   Net::SMTP. You may use all the friendly options that came bundled with
   Net::SMTP.  You can control the SSL usage with the options of new()
   constructor method.  'doSSL' option is the switch, and, If you would
   like to control detailed SSL settings, you can set SSL_* options that
   are brought from IO::Socket::SSL. Please see the document of
